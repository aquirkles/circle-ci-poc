# Circle CI POC

The purpose of this repo is simply to demonstrate how to integrate circle CI into a github build flow. The circleci config is located in the .circleci/config.yml file.

## Additional Steps

The content of the .npmrc file needs to be added as an environment variable in the circleci project...thats it!
